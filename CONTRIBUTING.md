## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor
or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility, a new version
should be immediately released to restore compatibility.
